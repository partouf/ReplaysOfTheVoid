# ReplaysOfTheVoid
Replay renamer for LotV replays (also HotS replays, but who cares about those!)

Can rename replay files to a custom format (example: "[RvR] - [Map] - [Player1], [Player2].SC2Replay")


### Requirements to build

If you wanna do it all yourself;

* Minimum VS Express 2013 for Desktop

* Extract contents of https://github.com/partouf/s2protocol to Debug/BlizzLibs

* Extract Lib folder of Python source https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/ to Debug/Lib

* NUGet should arrange IronPython to be installed with the VS Solution (if it doesn't load automatically, go to Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Click on the RESTORE button in the top right of the window)
